  * some others change (e.g., location, fuel).

  /** Drives the car toward the given destination. This causes the car’s location and its
    * fuel level to change.
    *
    * Assuming the car has enough fuel to reach the destination, it moves there. (In
    * effect, the car changes location just once and “teleports” to the destination,
    * with no intermediate steps.)
    *
    * If fuel runs out, the car stops along the way, and its new location is determined by finding the
    * location along the route where the car no longer has the fuel to move further. An example: A car
    * drives from (61.0, 25.0) towards the destination (62.0, 25.5), but only has fuel for 60% of the trip.
    * Consequently, it stops at (61.6, 25.3).
    *
    * For purposes of determining the car’s stopping point (if fuel runs out) and the amount of
    * fuel consumed by the drive, the car is assumed to move in a straight line “as the crow flies”
    * at a constant speed and to consume fuel evenly throughout.
    *
    * **Note:** As the example above illustrates, this method assumes that the car and its destination
    * exist not on a sphere (or geoid) but on a flat, two-dimensional surface whose x and y coordinates
    * map directly to longitude and latitude. The method relies on the assumption that the driven distance
    * is very short compared to the size of Earth, which allows this simplification.
    *
    * **Also note:** This method receives, as a parameter, the overall distance from the starting
    * location to the intended destination. The method relies on this information rather than attempting
    * to compute the number of meters between these two points.
    *
    * @param destination          the intended destination of the car
    * @param metersToDestination  the distance, in **meters**, from the car’s current location to `destination` */
